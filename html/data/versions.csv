Christoph Martin Wieland,,,"In 1762-66, Wieland published his translations of 22 of Shakespeare's plays in 21 volumes, kick-starting the German public's enthusiasm for Shakespeare. Wieland (1733-1812) was a very influential proto-Romantic and proto-Classicist novelist, dramatist, poet, founding editor of an influential literary journal, and translator from classical and modern languages. His prose translations of Shakespeare (with notes and comments often within the running text) were based on recent English editions (for Othello he used Warburton). Others soon attempted both more poetic versions, and more accurate versions. His versions remain 'canonical': his is the only public Othello e-text, apart from the 'standard' German Shakespeare - Baudissin's Othello from the Schlegel-Tieck edition.",http://www.delightedbeauty.org/vvv/Visualise?CorpusName=Othello%2C%20Act%201%20Scene%203&NameIfVersion=Wieland,m,"Othello, der Mohr von Venedig",1766,Biberach,48.095147,9.790152,47.971638819,9.195626953,48.07163882,9.445626953,48.095147,9.56015200,,,,,,,,,,Zurich,47.36865,8.539183,47.238650,8.539183,47.36865,8.539183,47.36865,8.539183,,,,,,,,,,Haffmans,,Book,Complete works,

His texts were further corrected (without his permission) by Gabriel Eckert, whose English was still better. Eckert published this edition in 1778-83. A public dispute ensued, but Eckert's revised edition became more widely accessible than the 'original' Eschenburg.

Ernst Ortlepp,,,"Ernst Ortlepp (1800-64) was a prolific writer, chiefly remembered for national-liberal political poems which sparked conflicts with censorship in the 1830s. These culminated in 1836 with him being forced to leave Leipzig, where he had studied and lived since 1817. After 1836 Ortlepp fell into obscurity, living and dying in poverty. His Shakespeare translations may have kept him afloat. They began with an edition of the poems, with Gottlob Regis, 1836; then he joined a play-translating team, contributing Othello to a Complete Plays issued by the publisher Kleman (1836-37); joined another team led by Adolph Böttger and contributed 2 more plays (Kleman 1842); and meanwhile Ortlepp issued an edition of 34 plays entirely translated by himself (Rieger, 1838-39). Ortlepp’s translations for the Böttger edition were revived in the 1860s when the mass-market publisher Reclam launched their popular cheap edition, the ‘Reclam Universal-Bibliothek’, and reprinted the Böttger edition’s texts. Reclam’s Shakespeare appeared in time to rival other editions, such as Bodenstedt’s (q.v.) new translations and Hermann Ulrici’s revision of the Schlegel-Tieck edition (mostly by Baudissin, q.v.).",http://www.delightedbeauty.org/vvv/Visualise?CorpusName=Othello%2C%20Act%201%20Scene%203&NameIfVersion=Ortlepp,m,"Othello, der Mohr von Venedig",1839,Stuttgart,48.775418,9.181759,48.82541799,9.181759,48.785418,9.181759,48.775418,9.181759,,,,,,,,,,Stuttgart,48.775418,9.181759,48.82541799,9.181759,48.785418,9.181759,48.775418,9.181759,,,,,,,,,,Rieger,,Book,Complete works,
Baudissin,Tycho Mommsen,,"Wolf Graf Baudissin (1789-1878) translated 15 of Shakespeare’s plays for the so-called ‘Schlegel-Tieck’ edition (1825-33), including ‘Othello’ (1832). This edition has never been out of print. Even 180 years later, it is the default Shakespeare for German-language readers, students, and theatres. Generations of editors have ‘improved’ and ‘corrected’ or restored the texts. Tycho Mommsen (1819-1900), brother of the famous historian Theodor Mommsen, was a school headteacher from Oldenburg, and is still often mentioned by Shakespeare textual scholars in connection with the theory of ‘memorial reconstruction’, which he suggested in a letter to the London magazine ‘The Athenaum’ in 1857. Mommsen published a study of the ‘Perkins Folio’ Hamlet (1854) (in which he fell victim to John Payne Collier’s forgery), a critical edition of ‘Romeo and Juliet’, and a book on the ‘art of translation from modern languages’ (both 1859). Around 1850, Mommsen took on the task of revising the ‘Schlegel-Tieck’ translations for the publisher of the original edition (Reimer, Berlin). An edition with Mommsen’s revisions appeared in 1850-51, but our ‘Othello’ text is from an 1867 reprint of an edition dated 1855. Mommsen writes in a short afterword that he did not touch Schlegel’s translations (‘masterpieces’) but completely retranslated ‘Macbeth’, and made many changes in some other plays. But he says he hardly touched ‘Othello’ (which he thought had been translated by Tieck) – he only corrected a few errors of ‘incomprehensibility, and harshness of expression and syntax’. The task of the translator, Mommsen wrote here, was to achieve a ‘higher fidelity’ by finding a ‘middle path’ between the ‘philologist’s calmness’ and the ‘poet’s mood and freedom’, in order to ‘maintain the feeling that he is writing like a German author’ and create an ‘analogue of foreign literature in the German tongue’ which can ‘have an effect on the public’.",http://www.delightedbeauty.org/vvv/Visualise?CorpusName=Othello%2C%20Act%201%20Scene%203&NameIfVersion=Baudissin%20ed%20Mommsen,"m, m","Othello, der Mohr von Venedig",1851,Dresden,51.050409,13.737262,51.050409,13.737262,51.050409,13.737262,51.050409,13.737262,Oldenburg,53.147739,8.210603,53.326839749,7.4926093,53.206839752,7.852609375,53.147739,8.210603,Berlin,52.519171,13.406091,52.519171,13.406091,52.519171,13.406091,52.519171,13.406091,,,,,,,,,,Reimer,,Book,Complete works,

Friedrich Theodor Vischer,,,"Friedrich Theodor Vischer (1808-87) was a prominent academic, an influential philosopher of Hegelian aesthetics. In his youth he was a national-liberal activist, and later a successful novelist, poet and dramatist. His translations of 15 of Shakespeare’s plays appeared posthumously, edited by his son Robert, in a series of books titled ‘lectures for the German people’, based on public lectures. Each play has a detailed introduction and is followed by a lengthy commentary and appreciation. The translations are footnoted with glosses and occasional criticisms of errors in the Schlegel-Tieck edition. Robert Vischer tells us that the lectures were delivered in Stittgart in 1869 to 1887, and also that they are mostly his father’s own work, rather than just reworkings of the (‘standard’) Schlegel-Tieck texts, i.e. Baudissin’s (q.v.) texts, in most cases. It is not clear what Vischer intended with his translations and how they relate to the presentation of public lectures on the popular subject of Shakespeare’s work. The print copy of Vischer’s ‘Othello’ used here (the volume also contains his ‘King Lear’), has interesting marginalia. Two readers, one in 1905 and one in 1950, have written numerous comments on Vischer’s translations and interpetations in the margins of the pages. Neither has much good to say about Vischer’s work, and when the earlier reader does agree with Vischer, the later one criticises the ‘limitations of 19th-century views’.",http://www.delightedbeauty.org/vvv/Visualise?CorpusName=Othello%2C%20Act%201%20Scene%203&NameIfVersion=Vischer,m,Othello,1887,Tübingen,48.521636,9.057645,48.259843789,8.430392577,48.509843789,8.540392578,48.391636,9.007645,,,,,,,,,,Stuttgart,48.775418,9.181759,48.82541799,9.181759,48.785418,9.181759,48.775418,9.181759,,,,,,,,,,Cotta,,Book,>10 plays,

Erich Engel,,,"This is an unpublished theatre script, adapted from Baudissin's version by Erich Engel, in 14 scenes, for a production he directed at the Deutsches Theater, Berlin, in 1939. Engel (1891-1966) was the leading German director of Bertolt Brecht's early work in the 1920s, and also a prolific film director (after the war, in East Germany). His 1939 production of Othello starred Ferdinand Marian as Iago and Ewald Balser as Othello. On the eve of war, under Nazi rule, the production affirmed humanistic values (Wilhelm Hortmann, ""Shakespeare on the German Stage. Vol 2: 20th Century"" 1998, pp. 148ff. ). Reviewers noted that the Moor appeared as a man of 'soldierly self-possession' and 'masculine nobility', and Iago as a 'Levantine'. Engel drastically revised the text. His changes include cutting Iago's closing speeches in Act 1 Scene 3 (scene 4 in Engels) and Act 2, Scene 4 (scene 5 in Engels). Only a very short version of the 1/3 monologue closes the harbour scene. Thus Iago's motivations are unclear. The opening scene of the 2010 film “Jew Suss: Rise and Fall” (“Jud Süß – Film ohne Gewissen”, dir. Oskar Roehler) is based on this production: Iago/Marian (Tobias Moretti) and Othello/Balser (identified in the film as Adolf Wilhelm Deutscher, and Jewish) give a private pre-premiere performance for Joseph Goebbels (Moritz Bleibtreu). Among other historical inaccuracies: the actors speak Baudissin's version of the dialogue, not Engels's; 'Othello' wears crude blackface: in Engel's production, visual and behavioural 'racial difference' was in one sense moderated, in another deflected. Othello appeared as a light-brown-skinned ‘Berber’ (a North African) while Iago, as a ‘Levantine’, appeared as the more reviled ‘racial other’.

Her text exists in the form of an unbound typescript, with a handwritten date ‘1941’ on the folder cover, in the Shakespeare Library at Munich University. It seems never to have been studied or perhaps even read, let alone performed or published. Schwarz’s translations of 8 other Shakespeare plays, in theatre publishers’ editions (not for the book trade), are recorded in Blinn and Schmidt’s ‘Shakespeare – deutsch’ bibliography (2003), where they are variously dated 1938-41, and 1955.

This edition has never been out of print. Even 180 years later, it is the default Shakespeare for German-language readers, students, and theatres. Generations of editors have ‘improved’ and ‘corrected’ the texts. Karl Brunner (1887-1965) was a Professor of English Language and Literature who published in the 1920s and 30s on topics from medieval epics to contemporary American poetry. He became the Rector of Innsbruck University (Austria) in 1937-38. He was then forced into retirement, because he protested after the German National Socialists took over Austria. He published on Anglo-Saxon grammar during the Second World War. When the war ended, he was re-appointed as Rector in 1945-46. In 1946-47, Brunner published dual-language editions of ‘Hamlet’, ‘Othello’ and ‘Romeo and Juliet’, as well as a translation of Washington Irving’s ‘Sketchbook’. Brunner used the ‘Globe’ Shakespeare edition of 1864 for his English text, and revised the German texts of the Schlegel-Tieck edition (in the case of ‘Othello’, that means Baudissin’s text). Brunner made changes where the German text seemed to him to be outdated, or to be based on a misunderstanding or a faulty source.

Theodor von Zeynek,,,"Theodor Ritter von Zeynek (1873-1948) was a colonel in the Austrian army, serving in general staff headquaters and on the Eastern Front during the First World War. He retired in 1918 and spent the rest of his life writing military history, autobiography, studies of Goethe, poems to accompany Beethoven’s sonatas, and translations of 37 of Shakespeare’s plays. His Shakespeare texts were unpublished at his death. Many (not Othello) were published in the 1950s and 60s in a cheap book series run by followers of Othmar Spann (1878-1950).

Hans Rothe,,,"In the 1920s-30s and the 1950s-60s, Hans Rothe (1894-1978) was a very popular and controversial Shakespeare translator. He was very popular with theatres and readers – his work was widely staged and he published a ‘selected’ twelve plays in 1927-35. But Shakespeare scholars attacked him for taking liberties with plays' structures and misinterpreting Shakespeare's language, and the National Socialist regime (1933-45) persecuted him. The Culture Minister, Josef Goebbels, personally denounced Rothe’s ‘liberal’ and ‘democratic’ work in 1936. He fled from Germany. He returned after the end of the war and published a Complete Plays (1955-59), including Othello. In his later work he was far more faithful to his source texts than he had been before the war. He titled his collection ""The Elizabethan Shakespeare"", claiming to understand the ‘true’ Shakespeare, as a practical dramatist and man of his time, far better than other translators. Other translators, even today, tend to dismiss Rothe's work as incompetent and vulgar. Rothe seems to have revised his own work frequently. The text used here, published in a 1963 edition, differs in some details from the 1950s text.

From 1952-68 he worked for the German Service of the BBC, while publishing experimental poetry and political and cultural essays in Germany and Austria. Fried gave up the job to concentrate on politically engaged writing, and other projects including translations of Shakespeare’s plays. Eventually he translated 27 of them (from 1964 to the end of his life). His translations are still in print as well as being used in theatres. Talking about the work of translating, Fried describes consulting multiple previous versions. He especially values Eschenburg, because of his pre-industrial language (see “Is Shakespeare Still Our Contemporary”, ed John Elsom, 1989, 39-40; ). Fried's Othello is dedicated (with sarcasm) to the British Home Secretary, Reginald Maudlin, who ordered the deportation of Rudi Dutschke, a leader of the German student movement.

Reinhold Rüdiger (1926-98) was artistic director of the Landesbühne (state theatre) Hannover for 30 years, and translated 10 plays including 5 by Shakespeare (scripts distributed by theatre publisher Felix Bloch Erben). In a short preface, Rüdiger explains his decision to base his work on the translation by Bodenstedt (q.v.). He rejects Baudissin (q.v.) because “unfortunately Schlegel did not translate Othello”. He rejects Eschenburg’s (q.v.) prose version. He rejects recent blank verse versions because they translate line by line and so “often come to a bad German sentence construction”; his verse translation (he writes) often turns one line of Shakespeare into one and a half or even two lines (or a metrically long line). Where Iago is conventionally translated “Jago” (2 syllables), Rüdiger hs “I-a-go” (3 syllables). In place of the conventional Act and Scene divisions he presents the play in 12 scenes. (Cf. Engel’s script.) Whether Rüdiger’s Othello script has been used by other productions is not known. The script was typed manually, and includes revisions using 2 different typewriter fonts.

A theatre script agency distributes 12 of Buhss’s own scripts and 34 of his translations including 20 of Shakespeare’s plays, and 14 by Russian dramatists. His Othello, which premiered in Braunschweig in 1996, is a popular choice for directors, having been used by at least one production in most recent years. These productions usually advertise the play using the one-word title ‘Othello’, rather than the full title which Buhss gave to his script: ‘Othello, Venedigs Neger’ – ‘Othello, Venice’s Negro’ (where ‘Neger’ can also be translated ‘Nigger’, or metaphorically: ‘dupe’).",http://www.delightedbeauty.org/vvv/Visualise?CorpusName=Othello%2C%20Act%201%20Scene%203&NameIfVersion=Buhss,m,"Othello, Venedigs Neger",1996,Berlin,52.519171,13.406091,52.519171,13.406091,52.519171,13.406091,52.519171,13.406091,,,,,,,,,,Berlin,52.519171,13.406091,52.519171,13.406091,52.519171,13.406091,52.519171,13.406091,,,,,,,,,,Henschel,,Script,>10 plays,
Baudissin,Ruediger Wenig,,"Wolf Graf Baudissin (1789-1878) translated 15 of Shakespeare’s plays for the so-called ‘Schlegel-Tieck’ edition (1825-33), including ‘Othello’ (1832). This edition has never been out of print. Even 180 years later, it is the default Shakespeare for German-language readers, students, and theatres. Generations of editors have ‘improved’ and ‘corrected’ the texts. The most easily accessed ‘Othello’ e-text is based on a 1958 print edition of 'Schlegel-Tieck'. This e-text was created around the year 2000 by ‘Rod Andriz’, a pseudonym of slam poet and media designer/consultant Ruediger Wenig of Darmstadt. In 1997-2007, Wenig built a very extensive site devoted to Shakespeare, including translations of all the plays: william-shakespeare.de. The site still functions, but the Guest Book is closed. Wenig/Andriz took most of the texts from the German-language site of Project Gutenberg, but he scanned several texts himself from printed books, including ‘Othello’, and contributed these texts to Project Gutenberg. He scanned a common, popular 1950s edition, applied Optical Character Recognition software, checked the output against the pages, and also checked the texts against the English texts in Project Gutenberg, making many small revisions and additions to speech prefixes and stage directions, but not to speeches. On his own site, additions are marked using font colour.",http://www.delightedbeauty.org/vvv/Visualise?CorpusName=Othello%2C%20Act%201%20Scene%203&NameIfVersion=Baudissin%20ed%20Wenig,"m, m","Othello, der Mohr von Venedig",2000,Dresden,51.050409,13.737262,51.050409,13.737262,51.050409,13.737262,51.050409,13.737262,Darmstadt,49.877648,8.651762,50.0145773185,7.99728710699,49.92457731859,8.157287107,49.817648,8.461762,online,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Gutenberg Project,,Book,Complete works,
Lukas Bärfuss,,,"Lukas Bärfuss (b.1971) is a prominent Swiss dramatist and novelist, some of whose plays, such as ‘Our Parents’ Sexual Neuroses’ (2003), have been translated into a dozen languages. His adaptation of ‘Othello’, subtitled ‘Kurze Fassung’ (‘Short Version’), not only cuts scenes and speeches but reduces each speech to a compact form of words. It premiered in Hamburg in 2001 and was later also used as the basis of the script for a film. ‘Othello, ein Blue-Movie’ (dir. Lene Markusen, 2006) was made by members of the ‘400asa’ collective which Bärfuss co-founded in Zurich in 1998. The ‘Blue-Movie’ scenario is a mockumentary about a megalomaniac film director who is making a film out of ‘Othello, Kurze Fassung’; the on-set conflict culminates in the ‘Othello’ actor killing the ‘Desdemona’ actor. A superficially similar set-up (play-within-a-play), but a very different approach to language, features in Alvaro García de Zúniga’s ‘RadioOthello’ (staged in Zurich, 2008).",http://www.delightedbeauty.org/vvv/Visualise?CorpusName=Othello%2C%20Act%201%20Scene%203&NameIfVersion=B%C3%A4rfu%C3%9F,m,Othello – Kurze Fassung ,2001,Zurich,47.36865,8.539183,47.238650,8.539183,47.36865,8.539183,47.36865,8.539183,,,,,,,,,,Berlin,52.519171,13.406091,52.519171,13.406091,52.519171,13.406091,52.519171,13.406091,,,,,,,,,,Hartmann & Stauffacher,,Script,<10 plays,
"Feridun Zaimoglu, Günter Senkel",,,"Feridun Zaimoglu and Günther Senkel were commissioned to write an adaptation of Othello by the Munich Kammerspiele for a production directed by Luk Perceval in 2003. Zaimoglu was already a prominent novelist and well-known author of scabrous monologues based on interviews with disaffected youths of Turkish background (like him). This Othello production, with a white Othello and live jazz played on a black grand piano straddling an upturned white one, was a scandalous success. It ran for 6 years in Munich and then transferred to Hamburg, meanwhile touring to several international festivals. It opened the international programme at the 2006 ‘Complete Works’ festival at the Royal Shakespeare Company, Startford-on-Avon, to renewed scandal. The reduced-cast adaptation ends with the murder or attempted murder of Desdemona, changes some key plot points and adds some original material, and it features extremely brutal, present-day ‘street’ language in Iago’s part. The script, back-translated into English (by Conny Loder and others), was projected on surtitle displays for the Stratford shows, intensifying the assault on audiences’ sense of decorum. Zaimoglu and Senkel have since worked on scripts for numerous productions with Perceval and other directors, including adaptations of several other Shakespeare plays, and works by Moliere, Wedekind, and Lessing. Their Othello is the only adaptation they have also published in book form.",http://www.delightedbeauty.org/vvv/Visualise?CorpusName=Othello%2C%20Act%201%20Scene%203&NameIfVersion=Zaimoglu,"m, m",Othello,2003,Kiel,54.323293,10.122765,54.323293,10.122765,54.323293,10.122765,54.323293,10.122765,,,,,,,,,,Münster,51.951481,7.625539,51.951481,7.625539,51.951481,7.625539,51.951481,7.625539,,,,,,,,,,Monsenstein und Vannerdat,,Book,<10 plays,

Hans Zimmer,,,"Hans Zimmer (b.1946) is a dramatist and drama teacher, writing for the stage and radio, specialising in work for young people. His play ‘Othello steht im Sturm’ (‘Othello is under attack’) has been performed several times in German schools and youth clubs in recent years. The play is set in a football club. ‘O’ is a coloured player, a star; ‘Mona’ loves him; ‘Jojo’ and Rodrigo’ are jealous plotters. They convince O that Mona has deceived him with his best friend ‘Mike’; O ultimately kills Mona. The modern dialogue alternates with selections from Baudissin’s (q.v.) translation, sometimes adapted. Some of this ‘ancestral’ dialogue is given to ‘old’ character-roles which alternate with the ‘new; some is given to a chorus. In the passage which corresponds to Shakespeare Act 1 Scene 3, Mona’s parents, ‘Herr Brabant’ and ‘Frau Brabant’ (for Brabantio) demand that O be thrown out of the team, because of his relationship with Mona, but team manager ‘Prinz’ (for the Duke of Venice) resists. There are superficial parallels with the film adaptation ‘O’ (dir. Tim Blake Nelson, 2001), set in a high school in the American South, where the only African-American student is the star of the basketball team.",http://www.delightedbeauty.org/vvv/Visualise?CorpusName=Othello%2C%20Act%201%20Scene%203&NameIfVersion=Zimmer,m,Othello steht im Sturm,2007,Hannover,52.375892,9.73201,52.375892,9.73201,52.375892,9.73201,52.375892,9.73201,,,,,,,,,,Weinheim,49.544964,8.66027,49.65496399,9.35026999,49.641818589,9.119132809,49.5849639,8.970269990000000,,,,,,,,,,Deutscher Theaterverlag Weinheim,,Script,>10 plays,For children
